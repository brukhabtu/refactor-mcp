# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üöÄ Quick Start for New Sessions

**Documentation Navigation** - Use these commands to avoid duplicate work:

```bash
# Documentation overview
cat plan/README.md             # Full documentation map
cat plan/project-plan.md       # What we're building and why
cat plan/architecture.md       # Complete system design and provider pattern

# Interface specifications
cat plan/cli-interface.md      # Command-line interface
cat plan/mcp-interface.md      # MCP server tools
cat plan/data-models.md        # Pydantic models and types

# Implementation details
cat plan/rope-provider.md      # Python implementation specifics
cat plan/project-structure.md  # Code organization

# LLM workflow guidance
cat plan/llm-usage-patterns.md # Common patterns and anti-duplication
```

## Work Deduplication Strategy

### Before Starting New Work

1. **Check existing documentation**: Always read relevant plan files first
2. **Review current implementation**: Use `find refactor_mcp/ -name "*.py"` to see what exists
3. **Verify VS Code tasks**: Use existing tasks for development workflow

### Key Documentation Areas by Task Type

#### Adding New Providers
- Read: `plan/architecture.md` (Provider pattern)
- Read: `plan/rope-provider.md` (Implementation example)
- Check: `refactor_mcp/providers/` (Existing implementations)

#### Adding MCP Tools
- Read: `plan/mcp-interface.md` (Tool specifications)
- Read: `plan/data-models.md` (Request/response models)
- Check: `refactor_mcp/server/` (Existing server code)

#### CLI Development
- Read: `plan/cli-interface.md` (Command specifications)
- Check: `refactor_mcp/cli/` (Existing CLI code)
- Use: `uv run python -m refactor_mcp.cli --help` (Current state)

#### Testing
- Read: `plan/design-principles.md` (Testing philosophy)
- Check: `tests/` (Existing test structure)
- Use: `uv run pytest tests/ -v` (Run current tests)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Don't recreate existing documentation** - Always check plan/ first
2. **Don't implement without reading specs** - Each plan file has detailed requirements
3. **Don't skip error handling** - See `plan/design-principles.md` for error patterns
4. **Don't use different naming** - Follow established conventions in plan docs
5. **Don't create redundant files** - Use existing structure in `plan/project-structure.md`

### Implementation Status Tracking

**Phase 1 MVP (Current)**:
- [ ] Core provider interface (`plan/architecture.md`)
- [ ] Rope provider implementation (`plan/rope-provider.md`) 
- [ ] MCP server tools (`plan/mcp-interface.md`)
- [ ] CLI commands (`plan/cli-interface.md`)
- [ ] Data models (`plan/data-models.md`)

**Existing Code Structure**:
```bash
refactor_mcp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/           # ‚úÖ Logging and observability (basic)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging.py    # ‚úÖ Implemented
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ observability.py  # ‚úÖ Implemented
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other modules]   # ‚ùå Not yet implemented
```

Use `find refactor_mcp/ -name "*.py" | head -10` to check current implementation status.

## Documentation Freshness

All plan documentation was reorganized and deduplicated on 2025-06-08:
- Consistent `kebab-case.md` naming
- Focused files under 500 lines each  
- Clear cross-references between documents
- Eliminated duplication: reduced from 13 files (5,655 lines) to 11 files (2,528 lines)
- Single source of truth for all core concepts

## When Documentation is Unclear

If plan documentation doesn't cover your specific need:
1. Check if it belongs in an existing file
2. Create focused addition to appropriate plan file  
3. Update relevant cross-references
4. Maintain the kebab-case naming convention

## Project Overview

**refactor-mcp** is an AST refactoring engine designed specifically for LLM consumption through Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides safe, reliable Python code refactoring operations that AI systems can execute autonomously.

## Essential Commands

### Development Setup
```bash
# Initial setup
uv sync

# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Quick test run
uv run pytest tests/ --tb=short

# Code quality (lint + format + typecheck)
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format . && uv run mypy refactor_mcp/

# Full development cycle
uv run pytest tests/ --tb=short && uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format . && uv run mypy refactor_mcp/ && uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Run CLI help
uv run python -m refactor_mcp.cli --help
```

## Architecture

### Core Design Pattern: Pluggable Providers

The system uses a **Provider pattern** to support multiple refactoring engines:

- **Phase 1**: Rope provider (Python expertise, battle-tested)
- **Phase 2**: Tree-sitter provider (multi-language breadth)  
- **Phase 3**: Specialized providers (rust-analyzer, LibCST, etc.)

### Dual Interface System

- **MCP Server**: AI-optimized tool interface for programmatic consumption
- **CLI Interface**: Human-friendly testing, debugging, development workflow

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Explicit-First Design**: No hidden state, predictable behavior for LLM interactions
- **Symbol-First Operations**: Use qualified names (`auth.utils.login`) rather than line positions
- **Discovery-Driven Workflow**: Find ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí refactor patterns
- **Auto-Generated IDs**: Stable references for anonymous elements (`function.lambda_1`)

## Core Operations (MVP)

1. **Symbol Analysis** - Get symbol information (definition, type, scope)
2. **Symbol Renaming** - Safe cross-codebase renaming with conflict detection  
3. **Method Extraction** - Extract code regions into new methods
4. **Reference Finding** - Locate all symbol usages across project
5. **Anonymous Element Discovery** - Find and extract lambdas, expressions, code blocks

## Command Interface Patterns

```bash
# Symbol discovery and analysis
refactor-mcp find <symbol-pattern>
refactor-mcp analyze <symbol>
refactor-mcp show <function>              # Discover extractable elements

# Refactoring operations  
refactor-mcp rename <symbol> <new-name>
refactor-mcp extract <source> <new-name>  # Unified extract command

# Examples with qualified names
refactor-mcp rename "auth.utils.login" "authenticate"
refactor-mcp extract "users.process_user.lambda_1" "is_adult"
```

## Code Structure

### Package Layout
- `refactor_mcp/shared/` - Core utilities (logging, observability)
- `refactor_mcp/providers/` - Refactoring engine implementations  
- `refactor_mcp/cli/` - Command-line interface
- `refactor_mcp/server/` - MCP server implementation

### Key Components

- **OperationTracker**: Tracks refactoring operations for observability with context managers
- **RefactoringProvider Protocol**: Standard interface for all refactoring engines
- **RefactoringEngine**: Central registry and router for providers

## Testing Strategy

Use pytest with provider mocking. Test files should focus on:
- Provider interface compliance
- Symbol resolution accuracy  
- Refactoring safety (no code breakage)
- Error handling and disambiguation

## Development Workflow

### VS Code Integration
The project includes pre-configured VS Code tasks:
- `setup`, `test`, `test-quick`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `quality`, `dev-cycle`

### Git Workflow Tools
- `./gw.sh` - Create git worktrees for parallel development
- `./gwr.sh` - Interactive worktree cleanup
- `./dev-start.sh` - Guided development startup

### Package Management
Always use UV for dependencies:
```bash
uv add <package>  # Never edit pyproject.toml directly
```

## Error Handling Philosophy

All operations should fail explicitly with actionable suggestions:
- **Ambiguous symbols**: Return candidates with qualified names
- **Multiple extractable elements**: Show available options with auto-generated IDs
- **Symbol not found**: Provide "did you mean" suggestions

This promotes error-driven learning for LLM interactions.

## Claude Background Tasks

This project includes a Claude task management system for running background Claude Code sessions that you can check on later. This is useful for long-running operations, parallel development, and tracking conversation history.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start a background Claude task
.claude/ct start <name> "<message>" [directory]

# Continue an existing task
.claude/ct continue <name> "<message>"

# List all running/completed tasks
.claude/ct list

# View task conversation
.claude/ct conversation <name>

# Remove a completed task
.claude/ct remove <name>
```

### Examples

```bash
# Start a refactoring task
.claude/ct start refactor "Implement the Rope provider for symbol analysis"

# Continue the task later
.claude/ct continue refactor "Now add error handling for ambiguous symbols"

# Check task status
.claude/ct list

# View the conversation
.claude/ct conversation refactor

# Clean up completed tasks
.claude/ct remove refactor
```

### Task Management Features

- **Non-blocking execution**: Tasks run in background, return immediately
- **Conversation history**: All requests and responses are tracked
- **Session resumption**: Continue tasks with session IDs automatically
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles failed commands and non-JSON output
- **Path isolation**: Tasks run in their correct project directories
- **Cleanup management**: Remove completed tasks to keep workspace clean

### Implementation Notes

- **Tool restrictions**: Currently disabled to ensure basic functionality; can be re-enabled later for security
- **Monitoring**: Background processes monitor task completion and update conversation history
- **JSON output**: Tasks use `--output-format json` for structured response parsing
- **Absolute paths**: Handles directory changes properly for cross-project task execution

## Target Success Metrics

- **Reliability**: 99.9% success rate on valid operations
- **Safety**: Zero false positives in conflict detection  
- **Performance**: <2s response time for typical operations
- **LLM Success**: AI can execute multi-step refactoring workflows
