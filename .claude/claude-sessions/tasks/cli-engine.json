Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### \u2705 Completed Tasks\n\n1. **Write failing test for 'analyze' command end-to-end** - Created comprehensive tests that verify the command fails appropriately and works with mocked engines\n2. **Implement minimal command wiring to pass analyze test** - Added the `analyze` command to the CLI with full error handling\n3. **Write failing test for 'find' command** - Created tests for the find command functionality\n4. **Implement find command wiring** - Added the `find` command with pattern matching support\n5. **Write failing test for 'rename' command** - Created tests for the rename command functionality\n6. **Implement rename command wiring** - Added the `rename` command with backup support\n7. **Test CLI commands work with real files** - Created integration tests that register real providers and verify end-to-end functionality\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Key Implementation Details\n\n**CLI Commands Added:**\n- `analyze <symbol> --file <path>` - Analyzes a symbol and shows its information\n- `find <pattern> --file <path>` - Finds symbols matching a pattern  \n- `rename <old_name> <new_name> --file <path>` - Safely renames symbols\n\n**Parameter Model Updates:**\n- Updated `AnalyzeParams`, `RenameParams`, `ExtractParams`, `FindParams`, and `ShowParams` to include `file_path` fields that the engine expects\n- Fixed field names to match engine expectations (`symbol` vs `symbol_name`, `old_name` vs `symbol_name`)\n\n**Error Handling:**\n- Proper validation of file paths and parameters\n- Clear error messages when no providers are available\n- Graceful handling of refactoring errors\n\n**Testing Strategy:**\n- Basic command tests (verify commands exist and fail appropriately without providers)\n- Mocked integration tests (verify CLI calls engine with correct parameters)\n- Real provider integration tests (verify end-to-end functionality with a test provider)\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Test Coverage\n\nAll 12 CLI tests pass:\n- 6 basic command tests (missing/success scenarios)\n- 3 mocked engine integration tests\n- 3 real provider integration tests\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Usage\n\nThe CLI is now fully functional:\n\n```bash\n# Show help\nuv run python -m refactor_mcp --help\n\n# Analyze a symbol (requires providers to be registered)\nuv run python -m refactor_mcp analyze test_function --file /path/to/file.py\n\n# Find symbols (requires providers to be registered)  \nuv run python -m refactor_mcp find test --file /path/to/file.py\n\n# Rename symbols (requires providers to be registered)\nuv run python -m refactor_mcp rename old_name new_name --file /path/to/file.py\n```\n\nThe CLI commands are now properly wired to the refactoring engine and ready for use once providers are registered with the engine.",
